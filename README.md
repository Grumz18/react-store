A eCommercial online store is created to apply theoretical skills
in learning the `React` library in the `JavaScript` language.

By writing this project, i want to learn how to use `React` to implement on the site the transition between pages with content without reloading the web page, a basket of selected products.

When working with this project, I used `Node.js`, namely npm, at startup:

### `npm create-react-app`[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The following technologies have been connected and used:

`Webpack` to handle and deprecate `import / require()` statements.
`Babel` to convert JSX to JS code.
`React-slick` for the slider on the main page of the site.

To run this project on a computer, the `Node.js` library must be installed on the computer: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Navigating to the project directory to run it, you write the command to the console. For example:

### ![Screenshot](https://github.com/Grumz18/myscreens/blob/main/scrin5.jpg)

### `npm start`

To stop the local server, use keyboard shortcut in your terminal `Ctrl+C`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

When developing, I used the following documentation:
1. https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
2. https://reactrouter.com/en/main
3. https://react-slick.neostack.com/docs/get-started
4. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
